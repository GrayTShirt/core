Notes
=====

To test the SHA512 and HMAC-SHA512 implementation:

    CPPFLAGS=-DTEST make sha && ./sha

The complicated Javascript (like the BoardCode parser / evaluator) is all
tested via QUnit, which can be found in api/qunit.  We use blanket.js to
instrument each source javascript with counters, for gathering code
coverage statistics.
